This project allows you to analyze the sentiment and emotions expressed in a given text input. It uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to classify text sentiment as positive, negative, or neutral and also identifies emotions present in the text based on a predefined list of emotions. The project provides a graphical user interface (GUI) built with tkinter, where you can input your text and receive sentiment and emotion analysis along with a visual representation of the emotions.
